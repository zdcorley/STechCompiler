# This config file is very picky. I was lazy with the parsing...
#
# The comment symbol is the pound key, and MUST be the first char on a line
# All config semantics below cannot contain spaces
# There are 2 types of config semantics:
# 	1. out
#		- loc index semantics will be used with the out keyword
#		- built in var semantics will prepend a temp var at the start of the stage func
#			and assign to the keyword at the end of the stage func
#	2. in
#		- loc index semantics will be used with the in keyword
#		- built in var semantics will prepend a temp var at the start of the stage func
#			that is init to the built in. 
#
# There are 2 operators:
# 	1. = equals means the semantic maps to a built in var
#	2. : colon means the semantic maps to a location index
